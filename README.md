Hello, I'm a Full-Stack & Researcher in Artificial Intelligence focused on Temporal Analysis, Behavioural Psychology and Learning Theory.

With 10 years of experience in the Machine Learning area, today I am focused on creating scalable products combining behavioral psychology.

One area I have a great interest in is learning theory, and how machines with humans can generate creativity and knowledge, under the strong influence of thinkers like Luhmann and Goethe.
