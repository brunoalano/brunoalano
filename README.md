# Hi, I'm Bruno ðŸŽ¯

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunoalano/brunoalano/master/img.png" alt="Bruno Alano - Full Stack Developer & AI Researcher">

I am a generalist focused on product, deep learning and blockchain.

I worked 7 years as Leadster's CTO & Founder, responsible for building the product, team and culture. I also worked as an external researcher at OpenAI, focusing on natural language processing and recurrent networks, as well as contributing in an opensource way to projects related to machine learning.

Between 2017 and 2019, I helped build a cryptocurrency protocol called ECC, focusing on scalability via shardings, but the project ended up being discontinued due to technical limitations. I have experience developing smart contracts and DeFi applications, where my personal focus is on onboarding latin america into web3 ecosystem.
